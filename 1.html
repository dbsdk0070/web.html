and web applications. web browsers receive HTML documents
from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages.
HTML describes the structure of a webpage semantically and originally
included cues for the appearance of the document. </p>

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML page. With HTAML
constructs, imaes and other objects, such as interactive forms,
may be embedded into the rendered page. It privides a means
to create strucured documents by denoting structural semantics for
text such as headings, paragraphsm lists, links, quotes and other items.
HRML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets
